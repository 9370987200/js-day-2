   <div><p> 1.What is creation phase and execution phase?</p>
    <p> creation phase: In the first run it picks all functions and variables declarations and stores them in memory
     with their reference
     In second run it picks all vaariables and assign undefined to them <br>
      execution phase : A phase where the actual code execution begins .and variables gets values.</p>
    </div>


 <div> <p> 2. What are objects in javascript?</p>
    <p> In javascript objects are standlone entity with properties and type.
      Object is collection of key-value pair and this pair is called property.</p>
     <pre>const car={
      type:"fiat",
      model:"500",
      color:"white"
  }
  console.log(car.color)
  
  output: white
  </pre>
</div>


<div><p>3.What are function constructors?</p>

    <pre>function person(first,last,age,eye){
        this.firstname=first;
        this.lastname=last;
        this.age=age;
        this.eyecolor=eye;
    }
    const mymother= new person("aruna","bhagyawant",40,"brown")
    console.log(mymother)
    
    output: create new person mymother with properties 
    firstname:aruna 
    lastname:bhagyawant 
    age:40 
    eyecolor:brown
    </pre>
</div>

<div><p>4.What are callbacks?</p>
    A callback is a function passed as an argument to anather function. this technique allow a functionto call another 
    function . a callback function can run after another functionhas finished.
    <pre>function mydispayer(sumthing){
        console.log(sumthing)
    }
    function mycalculater(num1,num2,mycallback){
        let sum=num1+num2
        mycallback(sum)
    }
    mycalculater(10,10,mydispayer)
    output:20
    </pre>
</div>

<div><p>5.Explain prototypes</p>
    <p>Every object in javascript has a build in property, which is called its prototype.The prototype is itself an object 
        ,so the prototype will have its own prototype , making what's called prototype chain. The chain ends when 
        we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.</p>
    <pre>function brother(first,last,age){
        this.firstname=first
        this.lastname=last
        this.age=this.age
    }
    brother.prototype.nationality="english"
    const mybrother= new brother("shubham","bhagyawant",25)
    console.log('the nationality of my brother is '+ mybrother.nationality)
    output:the nationality of my brother is english
    </pre>
</div>

<div><p>6.What is prototype chain</p>
    <p>Every object in javascript has a build in property, which is called its prototype.The prototype is itself an object 
        ,so the prototype will have its own prototype , making what's called prototype chain. The chain ends when 
        we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.</p>
    <pre>function person(first,last,age,eye){
        this.firstname=first;
        this.lastname=last;
        this.age=age;
        this.eyecolor=eye;
    }
    const mymother= new person("aruna","bhagyawant",40,"brown")
    console.log(mymother)
    
    output: firstname:aruna 
            lastname:bhagyawant 
            age:40 
            eyecolor:brown
    </pre>
</div>


<div><p>7.Give an example of inheritance using function constructor</p>
    <p>Inharitance is usefull for code reusability :reuse properties and method ofan existing class when you create 
        a new class.</p>
    <pre>function myfriend(first,last,age){
        this.firstname=first
        this.lastname=last
        this.age=age
    }
    const myfriend1=new myfriend("john","rally",20)
    console.log(myfriend1.lastname)
    
    output: rally
    </pre>
</div>
